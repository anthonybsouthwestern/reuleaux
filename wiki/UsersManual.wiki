#summary Users Manual for Reuleaux, a mesh generator implementing a modified version of Ruppert's Algorithm for curves in 2D

= Running Reuleaux =

From the command line, navigate to the folder containing the binary Reuleaux file. Execute this file followed by the full filename with extension of the PSC file to be meshed. This file must end with the extension .psc. If a configuration file is being used, it must be in the same directory as the PSC file, and must end with the extension .cfg. The results will be stored in files located in the same directory as the PSC file.

The following is a key for the file extensions of the output created by running Reuleaux on a PSC. SVG files can be viewed with a standard web browser. Node and .ele files can be viewed using Triangle[1]. The .log file can be viewed with a standard text editor.

  * .log The logfile containing information about the mesh from several steps of execution.
  * .inp.svg The SVG file of the input provided. Often will not display all features because of later initialization of the bounding box.
  * .pre.svg The SVG file of the input with presplit points added but before initialization of the bounding box.
  * .fsa.svg The SVG file of the input after detecting small angles and initializing the bounding box.
  * .ini.svg The SVG file of the input after initializing the Delaunay triangulation.
  * .out.svg The SVG file of the final mesh triangulation.
  * .out.node The Triangle file of the final mesh triangulation.
  * .out.ele The Triangle file of the final mesh triangulation.
  * .int.svg The SVG file of the final mesh triangulation after removing the mesh outside of exterior features.
  * .rem.svg The SVG file of the final mesh triangulation after removing the mesh outside of exterior features and inside of small angle protection circles.
  * .zoom.svg The SVG file of the final triangulation zoomed in on a selected portion.

The script reuleauxAll.sh is run by execution from a command line. It will run all data files in the ‘data’ folder that is located in the same directory as the directory containing reuleauxAll.sh and reuleauxDir.sh.

= PSC File Format =

The .psc file format is an ASCII text file that specifies a piecewise smooth complex. Its goal is to fully describe a PSC including the intersection points between features. Note that the parser for a PSC file ignores any whitespace except to use it for separating characters. The text formatting, in particular newlines, is only for the user. Integer values can be entered instead of double values without the need for decimal point and following zero. It is critical to ensure that in the input PSC that all intersection points are explicitly specified. Failure to do so will cause the code to crash.

A .psc file consists of 4 sections:
  # PSC
  # Dimension
  # Points
  # Curves

==Section 1: PSC section==

This section identifies the file type.

First line: PSC

==Section 2: Dimension section==

This section specifies the dimensions of the PSC; the Reauleaux code only accepts two-dimensional PSCs.

First line: DIMENSION 2

==Section 3: Points section==

This section gives the coordinates of all the points in the PSC. It must include the points of all intersections of the curves defined in the PSC.

First line: POINTS _#points_

Remaining lines: _pointid xcoord ycoord_


_#points_ is an integer specify the number of points in the PSC.

_pointid_ should be a unique integer identifier.

_xcoord ycoord_ are the double values for the x and y coordinates of the point.

*Example:* Specifies 8 points, 00 is on the origin, 01 is one unit to the right along the x axis, and 02 is one unit up and two to the right of 00.

POINTS 8

00 0.0 0.0

01 1.0 0.0

02 2.0 1.0

03 2.0 0.0

04 0.0 1.5

05 3.0 1.5

06 0.0 4.0

07 3.0 4.0

==Section 4: Curves section==

This section defines all of the curves and curve segments in the PSC.

First line: CURVES _#curves_

Remaining lines A: _curveid curvetype curvedata_

Remaining lines B: _curvedatacontinued_

Remaining lines C: _curvedatacontinued_

_#curves_ is an integer specify the number of curves in the PSC.

_curveid_ should be a integer identifier unique for each curve.

_curvetype_ is one of the following types that are enumerated below: linesegment, circle, arc, bezier, bezier3, or nbezier and are described in their corresponding section.

_curvedata_ is dependent on the curve type and is specified in the following allowed curve types. Line C is only used with n-degree Be ́zier curves.

*Example A:* Specifies 6 curves.

CURVES 6

==Line Segments==

A line segment is characterized by:

Line A: _curveid_ linesegment _#segments_
Line B: _pointlist_

_#segments_ is a positive integer specifying the number of segments in a straight line separated by points.

_pointlist_ is a sequence of integer identifiers from the specified list of points in the points section A. There must be a minimum of two points listed, and the number of points specified is equal to one more than the number of segments.
